## Sample Problem (1pts)

### Problem

You have gathered N bags of candy and you want to distribute the candy amongst M kids. The i-th bag contains Ci pieces of candy. You want to make sure that every kid get the same amount of candy and that the number of pieces of candy they receive is the greatest possible. You can open each bag and mix all pieces of candy before distributing them to the kids.

How many pieces of candy will remain after you share the candy amongst kids, based on the rules described above? 

### Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T test cases follow.

Each test case consists of two lines. The first line of each test case contains two integers: integer N, the number of candy bags, and M, the number of kids.

The next line contains N non-negative integers C1,C2,â€¦,CN representing array C, where the i-th integer represents the number of candies in the i-th bag. 

### Output

For each test case, output one line containing `Case #x: y`, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the number of candies that will remain if you divide candies between kids according to the rules described above.

## Centauri Prime (5pts, 7pts)

### Problem

Alice and Bob are playing the game called Centauri Prime. Centauri Prime represents a planet which is split into several independent kingdoms. Before they start playing the game, they have to choose rulers for each kingdom. Alice and Bob mutually decided to distribute kingdoms based on the letter the kingdom's name ended with. Alice loves vowels and decided to rule kingdoms whose names ended in a vowel. Bob loves consonants and decided to rule kingdoms whose names ended in a consonant. Both of them do not like the letter 'y'(case insensitive) and thus, all kingdoms whose names ended in the letter 'y' are left without a ruler. Can you write a program that will determine the rulers of several kingdoms, given the kingdoms' names? 

### Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow, each one containing the name of one kingdom. Kingdom names will consist of only lower case English letters, starting with a capital letter. There will be no other characters on any line, and no empty lines.

List of vowels for this problem is ['A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']. 

### Output

For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: K is ruled by Y., where x is the case number (starting from 1), K is the kingdom name, and Y is either Alice, Bob or nobody.

Be careful with capitalization and the terminating period. Your output must be in exactly this format. See the examples below.
